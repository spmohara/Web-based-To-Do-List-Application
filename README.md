Overview
========

During my busy weeks full of various homework assignments, quizzes, exams, projects, meetings, work, etc., things can get a little overwhelming at times. I created this simple web-based application because I got tired of forgetting to do certain tasks and wanted somewhere I could look, regardless of where I was, to view everything I needed to get done each week without having to write them down and risk losing them. With this application, tasks can be added, modified, or marked completed using any device with Internet access.

Description
===========
Used Python to execute methods, a C library called SQLite to implement an SQL database engine, a Python WSGI micro web-framework called Bottle to route data, and basic HTML & CSS to create my own locally hosted website. I then setup a web server on a Raspberry Pi, along with using an Apache module called mod_wsgi to host my Python application, and then port forwarded my local IP address to my routers public IP address in order to make it available on the web.
