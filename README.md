During my busy weeks full of various homework assignments, quizzes, exams, projects, meetings, work, etc, things can become a little overwhelming at times. The primary reason I created this simple web-based application was because I grew more and more frustrated when I forgot to do certain tasks and wanted somewhere I could look, regardless of where I was, to view everything I needed to get done in a given week without having to write it down and risk losing the task. The beauty of this application is it is web-based and tasks can be added, edited, or marked completed to remove from the list, using any device with Internet.

DESCRIPTION
Used Python to execute methods, a C library called SQLite to implement an SQL database engine, a Python WSGI micro web-framework called Bottle to route data, and basic HTML & CSS to create my own locally hosted website. I then setup a web server on a Raspberry Pi, along with using an Apache module called mod_wsgi to host my Python application, and then port forwarded my local IP address to my routers public IP address in order to make it available on the web.
